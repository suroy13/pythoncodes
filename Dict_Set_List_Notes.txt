Set in python only return unique values that is if we have same item in list more than once
still it will return the item only once

set={1,2,3,3,3,4,5,7}

it will retun 
1,2,3,4,5,7 only

Set are unordered, so if we need ordered we need to use list

------------------------------

empty set can be declated as 

set=()

empty disctionary 

dict ={}
